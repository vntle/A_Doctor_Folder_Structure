| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. ManuscriptX | For each manuscript, make a new folder. You can use the ManuscriptX.zip template for it, it contains the same empty folder structure you see here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1.1. Figures   | The place for the figures you (maybe) want to use in your manuscript. For each figure, is is a good idea to provide how and from which data it was generated, ideally not only as a note / link in the README, but directly in the figure folder. This way, recreating figures for specific manuscripts is much easier. Storing the intended caption extern to the figure also helps to stay organized. More information can be found in the guidance [G_ManuscriptFigures_README](/PhD/04_Publications/ManuscriptX/01_Figures/G_ManuscriptFigures_README.md). |
| 1.2. Drafts    | The place for the many versions of your manuscript draft. Keeping older versions helps to roll back to previous formulations and to prove who has written what at which point in time. To not clutter your work space too much, move obsolete versions to the *zzz* folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1.3. Submitted | For each journal you submit to (if it is more than one), create a folder with exactly those files you are uploading. Adjust the file names to match the order of upload so it is less likely you overlook a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.4. Revision  | Usually, revision is necessary, so here you can store the according correspondence and the updated manuscript. You will receive feedback from the editor and peer reviewers and most likely you will need to write a rebuttal letter. For a resubmission, consider to create a folder with the to-be-submitted files as in the prior step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.5. Published | This is the place to store the published version in case it is not available online for some reason. Some publishers grant you only limited / timed access to your publication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.


## Best Practice Recommendations

### Authorship and Acknowledgements
Lack of transparency and unclear **communication** about who is doing what for a manuscript and for which kind of credit is often a problem leading to frustration and authorship disputes. Ideally, all contributing persons should talk as early as possible about authorship. This also helps to manage expectations on which work packages, actions, and how much effort is expected of the contributors. Authorship also comes with duties and **responsibilities** for the product and can also be declined.

When a contribution does not qualify for authorship, it is good practice to **acknowledge** it in the acknowledgement section of the manuscript. Note, however, that you should obtain written **consent** from people mentioned there first / before submission!

There are clear definitions on which **contributions justify authorship**. So-called honorary authorships infringe Good Research Practice.

### Open Access Publication
Publishing results and data under open access helps you to comply with increasingly stringent **funding requirements** and to contribute to more **collaborative and transparent science**. 
We recommend to prioritize open access publishing of as FAIR (see below) and open as possible data. This can involve pre-publishing with, e.g., BioRxiv; utilizing open licenses; and archiving of data in open access repositories. 
Note that you need to inform yourself on current policies and costs.

### Publishing Data
Data as basis of scientific results and conclusions needs to be made available to provide replicability, reproducibility, transparency. To allow others to understand and work with your data, it needs to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (= FAIR).
- Wilkinson, et al. (2016). **The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship**. _Scientific Data_, 3(1). [https://doi.org/10/bdd4](https://doi.org/10/bdd4)

The earlier you consider and plan for publishing your data, the easier it is to adhere to standards and best practices, like described in, for example:
- Engler, J. B. (2024). **Tidyplots empowers life scientists with easy code-based data visualization** (p. 2024.11.08.621836). bioRxiv. [https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.08.621836](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.08.621836)
- Wickham, H. (2014). **Tidy Data**. _Journal of Statistical Software_, 59, 1–23. [https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)
- Wickham, H., Cetinkaya-Rundel, M., & Grolemund, G. (2023). **R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data** (2nd ed.). O’Reilly Media. [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

Depending on your research field, expect that there are standards for data and metadata reporting, file formats, and other aspects of communicating data. For example:
- Brazma, A., et al. (2001). **Minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)—Toward standards for microarray data**. _Nature Genetics_, 29(4), 365–371. [https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1201-365](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1201-365)
- Hammer, M., et al. (2021). **Towards community-driven metadata standards for light microscopy: Tiered specifications extending the OME model**. _Nature Methods_, 18(12), 1427–1440. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01327-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01327-9)
- Orchard, S., et al. (2007). **The minimum information required for reporting a molecular interaction experiment (MIMIx)**. _Nature Biotechnology_, 25(8), 894–898. [https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt1324](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt1324)
- Ropelewski, A. J., et al. (2022). **Standard metadata for 3D microscopy**. _Scientific Data_, 9(1), 449. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01562-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01562-5)

The FAIRsharing database ([https://fairsharing.org/](https://fairsharing.org/)) is a valuable resource to identify relevant standards, databases, and policies.

Publishing data often requires its deposition in an accessible database, i.e, a repository. Finding suitable repositories is facilitated by the Registry of Research Data Repositories ([https://www.re3data.org/](https://www.re3data.org/)). 

How to choose a repository is detailed in this guide: Whyte, A.. (2015). **Where to keep research data: DCC checklist for evaluating data repositories**. V1.1. _Edinburgh: Digital Curation Centre_. [https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)

Published data can and should be cited, thereby enhancing the visibility and impact of the publishing researchers: Silvello (2018). **Theory and practice of data citation**. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 69: 6-20. [https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23917](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23917)


### Copyright

Researchers should be aware of copyright laws and licenses in context of research data and metadata in their institute or country. These licences state how to use, share, and deposit data in repositories or other platforms. In the most cases, machine-generated raw research data is not considered to hold any copyright. Further processed secondary data may be subject to copyright protection if is original or creative. Every researcher should provide at least a license for published data to indicate and promote the re-use of the data.


### References

The “Drafts” subfolder is also the place to store at least a list of references. Keep the references linked to the reference manager (e.g. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), or [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/)) until at least the submission. You should link or save the data from your reference manager (e.g., BibTeX export for Zotero) in the same folder. When using reference managers, describe their use in a README file and save a .bib export of the bibliography in the manuscript folder.
